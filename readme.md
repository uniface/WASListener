# WorkArea synchronisation for Uniface 10

This Work Area Support utility integrates the Uniface IDE with file-based version control systems by synchronising Uniface's repository with a directory structure (WorkArea) of exports. The utility will detect changes to the export files (like swapping git branches) and replay them within Uniface whilst also protecting against orphan definitions. 
The utility also keeps track of the developer's changes, allowing them to accept the updates or revert to the export file.
